# TicTacToe-MiniMax-Algo
Tic Tac Toe game with minmax algorithm


## Description:
TicTacToe is a fully functional Python project utilizing libraries such as Tkinter for its front-end graphical user interface. This project features a computer AI powered by the Minimax algorithm, providing a challenging opponent for players. The Minimax algorithm intelligently analyzes possible moves to make strategic decisions and attempt to win the game against the player.

### NOTE:
Please note that due to the computational complexity of the Minimax algorithm and Python's inherent performance characteristics, the game may exhibit slower response times during gameplay.
